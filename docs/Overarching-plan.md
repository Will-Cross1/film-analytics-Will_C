# Overarching Plan

## Group Planning
- Discuss which members are leading which projects and confirm individual responsibilities.
- Set up GitHub repository.
- Create and assign GitHub Project Board issues aligned with feature requirements and user stories.

---

## Backend Preparation
- Meet with the group to discuss:
   - Backend architecture (Node.js, Express.js, Supabase).
   - API structure, endpoints, and authentication.
   - GitHub Project workflow.
- Begin backend work:
   - Learn required frameworks and libraries.
   - Create user authentication and authorisation database.
   - Create reviews and ratings database.
   - Establish connection to OMDB API to retrieve movie data.
   - Integrate YouTube API to fetch and display trailers.
   - Ensure backend server runs reliably; add clear setup documentation in `README.md`.
   - Push initial backend endpoints to allow frontend development to begin.
   - Write and run tests for each endpoint and API call.

## Frontend Preparation
- Meet with the group to:
   - Review backend API endpoints.
   - Finalise frontend architecture, data flow, and component structure.
- Begin frontend work:
   - Learn required React, HTML, CSS and API calls.
   - Implement user login and registration interfaces.
   - Build movie search interface connected to the backend.
   - Develop movie detail pages displaying trailers, ratings, and reviews.
   - Add review creation and submission forms.
   - Implement trends visualisation (e.g., charts for box office trends) (time permitting).
   - Write and run frontend tests to ensure stability.

---

## Final Preparation
- Meet with the group to:
   - Test the entire project workflow (frontend-backend integration).
   - Identify and fix bugs.
   - Ensure documentation is complete for both backend and frontend.
   - Prepare environment setup instructions for testing.

---

## Video Presentation
- Begin preparing and recording the video presentation:
   - Demonstrate full system functionality.
   - Reflect on highlights, challenges, and resolutions during the project.
